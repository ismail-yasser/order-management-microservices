# Microservice-Based Order Management System Demo

This guide explains how to use and test the microservices-based Order Management System that demonstrates fault tolerance, resilience patterns, and the saga pattern for distributed transactions.

## System Architecture

The system consists of four separate microservices:

1. **Order Service (Port 3000)**
   - Manages order lifecycle
   - Orchestrates the saga pattern
   - Handles communication with other services

2. **Inventory Service (Port 3001)**
   - Manages product inventory
   - Handles inventory checks, reservations, and releases
   - Provides inventory status information

3. **Payment Service (Port 3002)**
   - Processes payments
   - Authorizes and refunds transactions
   - Maintains payment records
   
4. **Shipping Service (Port 3003)**
   - Creates and manages shipments
   - Generates shipping labels
   - Provides tracking information
   - Handles shipping status updates

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm
- Docker and docker-compose (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Setup Options

#### Option 1: Running services locally

1. Run the setup script to install dependencies for all services:
   ```
   setup.bat
   ```

2. Start all three services:
   ```
   start-services.bat
   ```

#### Option 2: Using Docker

1. Build and start all services using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Testing the System

Import the `OrderManagementMicroservices.postman_collection.json` into Postman to test the system.

### Postman Collection Structure

The collection is organized into four main folders:

1. **Order Service**
   - Health Check
   - Place Order (initiates saga)
   - Get Order
   - Get Order Events (shows saga execution flow)

2. **Inventory Service**
   - Health Check
   - Get Inventory Status
   - Check Inventory

3. **Payment Service**
   - Health Check
   - Authorize Payment

4. **Failure Scenarios**
   - Order with Invalid Inventory (demonstrates compensating transactions)
   - Chaos Mode (to test resilience patterns)

### How To Run The Demo

Follow these steps to see the system in action:

1. **Verify all services are healthy:**
   - Run the Health Check requests for all three services

2. **Check current inventory status:**
   - Run "Get Inventory Status" in the Inventory Service folder

3. **Place an order:**
   - Run "Place Order" in the Order Service folder
   - This initiates the saga pattern:
     1. Creates a pending order
     2. Checks and reserves inventory
     3. Processes payment
     4. Confirms order if all steps succeed

4. **View the order:**
   - Run "Get Order" to see the order details

5. **Examine the saga execution:**
   - Run "Get Order Events" to see all events in the saga
   - The events show the complete flow including any compensating actions

6. **Test failure handling:**
   - Run "Order with Invalid Inventory" to see how the system handles failures
   - Observe how compensating transactions are executed
   - The inventory should be automatically released when payment fails

7. **Enable chaos mode:**
   - Run "Chaos Mode" to introduce random failures
   - Then place more orders to see how the system handles these failures
   - The circuit breakers and retries should help maintain reliability

## Resilience Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Saga Pattern

The system implements the saga pattern for distributed transactions across microservices:
- Each step has a compensating action if a later step fails
- All steps are recorded as events for traceability
- Order status reflects the current state of the saga

### 2. Circuit Breakers

Circuit breakers are implemented using the Opossum library:
- Prevents cascading failures when a service is experiencing issues
- Automatically opens after configurable error thresholds
- Provides fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation

### 3. Retries

Retries are implemented for transient failures:
- Automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoff
- Helps handle temporary network issues or service unavailability

### 4. Idempotency

All operations support idempotency:
- Uses idempotency keys to prevent duplicate operations
- Safely handles retries without side effects

### 5. Metrics & Monitoring

Each service exposes metrics for monitoring:
- Circuit breaker states
- Operation durations
- Success/failure counts
- Standard system metrics

## Extending the Demo

To expand on this demo:
- Add more microservices (e.g., Shipping, Notification)
- Implement event sourcing for greater resilience
- Add a service mesh for more advanced traffic management
- Implement distributed tracing
