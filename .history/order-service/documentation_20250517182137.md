  *Note: Include your Lucidchart diagram here that shows the following components:*

  - **Services**: Order Service, Inventory Service, Payment Service
  - **Communication**: REST APIs, Event-based messaging
  - **Infrastructure**: Docker containers, Kubernetes orchestration

  ## 2. Service Descriptions

  ### Order Service
  - **Responsibility**: Manages the full lifecycle of customer orders
  - **Data Managed**: Order information, order state transitions, order events
  - **Key APIs**:
    - `POST /orders` - Create new order (initiates saga)
    - `GET /orders/:id` - Retrieve order details
    - `PUT /orders/:id` - Update order (shipping address)
    - `DELETE /orders/:id` - Cancel order
    - `POST /orders/:id/process` - Process order (confirm)
    - `POST /orders/:id/fulfill` - Fulfill and ship order
    - `GET /orders/:id/events` - Get order event history
    - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
    - `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics endpoint

  ### Inventory Service
  - **Responsibility**: Manages product inventory and stock levels
  - **Data Managed**: Product inventory, reservation records
  - **Key APIs**:
    - `GET /inventory/check` - Check inventory availability
    - `POST /inventory/reserve` - Reserve inventory for an order
    - `POST /inventory/release` - Release reserved inventory (compensation)
    - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
    - `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics endpoint

  ### Payment Service
  - **Responsibility**: Processes payments and manages payment statuses
  - **Data Managed**: Payment records, transaction history
  - **Key APIs**:
    - `POST /payments/authorize` - Authorize payment
    - `POST /payments/capture` - Capture authorized payment
    - `POST /payments/refund` - Process payment refund (compensation)
    - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
    - `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics endpoint

  ## 3. Communication Strategy

  ### Synchronous Communication (REST APIs)
  - **Use Cases**:
    - Direct user interactions requiring immediate response
    - Critical path operations (payment authorization, inventory check)
  - **Implementation**:
    - RESTful JSON APIs with proper HTTP status codes
    - Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
    - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
  - **Rationale**: Provides immediate confirmation for user-facing operations where eventual consistency isn't acceptable

  ### Asynchronous Communication (Event-Based)
  - **Use Cases**:
    - Order state change notifications
    - Cross-service data consistency
    - Audit logging
  - **Implementation**:
    - Event logging for all state changes
    - Event sourcing pattern for full history
  - **Rationale**: Allows for loose coupling between services, enables event replay, and supports data consistency patterns

  ### Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions
  - **Implementation**:
    - Choreography-based saga for order placement
    - Step 1: Create Order (Pending)
    - Step 2: Reserve Inventory
    - Step 3: Process Payment
    - Step 4: Confirm Order
  - **Compensating Transactions**:
    - Payment failure → Release inventory
    - Inventory failure → Cancel order
  - **Rationale**: Maintains data consistency across services without distributed transactions

  ## 4. Fault Tolerance and Resilience Strategy

  ### Circuit Breakers
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Using Opossum library for circuit breaking
    - Configured for inventory and payment services
    - Threshold: 50% error rate
    - Timeout: 3s (inventory), 5s (payment)
    - Reset: 10s (inventory), 30s (payment)
  - **Fallback Mechanisms**:
    - Inventory: Use optimistic response if service unavailable
    - Payment: Fail request with friendly message
  - **Benefits**: Prevents cascading failures, allows system to operate under partial failure

  ### Retry Mechanism
  - **Implementation**:
    - Using axios-retry for HTTP retries
    - Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 3s)
    - Only retry idempotent operations and 5xx errors
  - **Benefits**: Handles transient network issues and temporary service failures

  ### Request Idempotency
  - **Implementation**:
    - Idempotency keys via HTTP headers
    - In-memory cache of responses (would use Redis in production)
    - All write operations support idempotency
  - **Benefits**: Prevents duplicate operations, ensures exactly-once semantics

  ### Bulkhead Pattern
  - **Implementation**:
    - Separate circuit breakers per external service
    - Resource limits in Kubernetes configuration
  - **Benefits**: Isolates failures to specific components

  ### Health Checks
  - **Implementation**:
    - `/health` endpoint for kubernetes liveness probe
    - Container and pod health monitoring
  - **Benefits**: Enables automatic recovery from failed instances

  ### Chaos Testing
  - **Implementation**:
    - Random 500 errors with `CHAOS_MODE=true`
    - 5% of requests fail randomly
  - **Benefits**: Validates resilience mechanisms work properly

  ## 5. Data Consistency Strategy

  ### Event Sourcing
  - **Implementation**:
    - All state changes recorded as events
    - Events stored in chronological order
    - Current state can be rebuilt from event history
  - **Benefits**: Complete audit trail, temporal queries, and state reconstruction

  ### Eventual Consistency
  - **Implementation**:
    - Services may have temporary inconsistencies during saga execution
    - Event logs provide source of truth for reconciliation
  - **Benefits**: Allows system to function without distributed transactions

  ### Compensating Transactions
  - **Implementation**:
    - Explicit, recorded compensation events
    - Example: Inventory release after payment failure
  - **Benefits**: Maintains business-level consistency even during failures

  ### Saga Pattern
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Order placement as a multi-step saga
    - Explicit success/failure events for each step
  - **Benefits**: Atomic business operations across service boundaries

  ## 6. Deployment and Monitoring Considerations

  ### Containerization
  - **Implementation**:
    - Docker containers for all services
    - Alpine-based Node.js images
    - Multi-stage builds for smaller images
  - **Benefits**: Consistent environment, easy scaling

  ### Kubernetes Deployment
  - **Implementation**:
    - Deployment with 3+ replicas
    - Rolling update strategy for zero downtime
    - Resource limits and requests

    - Environment variable `CHAOS_MODE` enabled for testing
  - **Benefits**: High availability, automated scaling, resilient infrastructure

  ### Monitoring
  - **Implementation**:
    - Prometheus metrics for all services
    - Key metrics:
      - Order counts by status
      - Processing durations
      - Circuit breaker states
      - Error rates
      - `circuit_breaker_state`: Tracks the state of circuit breakers (0 = closed, 1 = open)
      - `retry_count`: Monitors the number of retries for failed requests
  - **Benefits**: Real-time system visibility, anomaly detection

  ### Structured Logging
  - **Implementation**:
    - Winston for structured JSON logging
    - Context enrichment (order IDs, customer info)
    - Log levels (info, warn, error)
  - **Benefits**: Easy troubleshooting, better observability

  ### Alerting
  - **Implementation**:
    - Alert on circuit breaker open
    - Alert on high error rates
    - Alert on slow response times
  - **Benefits**: Proactive issue detection
